So, let me walk you through the content of this course.

10
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:51.166
First, we’ll learn about the history of investment banking. This part of the course is fundamental

11
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.232
for anyone who wants to understand the industry fully.

12
00:00:54.233 --> 00:01:01.133
We will talk about the conception of investment banking services, about the type of securities first offered to clients,

13
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:05.699
and about the differences between commercial and investment banks.

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Then, we will start learning about the four main areas of investment banking. We will provide a detailed

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:19.333
description of the services offered by the Capital Markets, Advisory, Trading, and Asset Management divisions.

16
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:26.433
This part of the course would allow you to understand how the investment banking business functions nowadays.

17
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:35.299
You will learn about the mechanics of Initial Public Offerings, Seasoned Equity Offerings, Private Placements,

18
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:45.700
Bond Issuances, Loan Syndications, Securitizations, Mergers and Acquisitions, Restructurings, Trading Instruments,

19
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.000
and Asset Management vehicles. This is the complete theoretical framework you will need

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.966
to understand Investment Banking services properly

21
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.966
Next, we will introduce you to company valuation.

22
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:07.266
You will learn how to value a company, what drives a firm’s value, how to calculate its cost of capital

23
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.299
and how to forecast future cash flows.

24
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.633
Then when you learn a bit about financial modeling and some best practices, you will be ready to start building valuation models.

25
00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:26.533
We will teach you how to value a company by building a Discounted Cash Flow model from scratch,

26
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:31.933
which is one of the key topics that will come up in investment banking interviews.

27
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:39.366
And finally, we’ll look at Leveraged Buyouts. LBOs are another common topic in interviews

28
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:47.099
and that’s why we’ll learn how they function, who carries them out and how to build an LBO model in practice.

29
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.000
